## Landscapes dataset

The landscapes dataset is just under 4000 images in seven categories of landscape/environment: city, road, mountain, lake, ocean, field, and forest.

This is a toy dataset to help explain how to gather, process, and structure data, and to use in some of ML5's learning examples.

In the 'licenses' folder, you'll find a JSON file for each category. Each file has a list of the photos and each photo's url, full file name, license, image title, owner's username, cleaned file name (just the number and extension), keyword (same as the category), and owner id.

The license field here is important. These images are pulled from Flickr, which has the licensing system available here: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.licenses.getInfo.html

**IMPORTANT**

#### If you are building upon these images or doing generative machine learning projects with these images, you must take out photos with licenses 3 and 6, as these do not allow remixing.

No image in this dataset has a '0' license, which is for all rights reserved.
